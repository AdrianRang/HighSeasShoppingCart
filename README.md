# HighSeas Shopping Cart
How will you spend your doubloons?

Check the page out [here](https://adrianrang.github.io/HighSeasShoppingCart/)

This was made to make it easier to decide what to use doubloons on, you can add multiple products, it will tell you how many doubloons you will have left over, and if you don't have enough, it will tell you how many doubloons are missing, and it will show in yellow any product where removing one will get you to be able to afford, red where removing more than one will get you to afford, and if removing all won't get you to afford it won't get you to afford it wont get recolored.

> PS  
> The total won't show on cellphone/no fullscrean it's to the right using transform, but it works trust me :)
